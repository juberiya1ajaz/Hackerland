# GRooVE with NFTs
Let's bring your instruments and Groove with NFTs.

## 💡Inspiration
As we all know, musicians struggle financially. Most musical artists are getting underpaid due to three main reasons: **copyright infringement, streaming services, and labels taking advantage of their work**. Less-known music groups have suffered the negative impact of the current trends in the music industry. According to the Pew Research Center, 79% of music downloaders gather music files for free. With the billions of songs available on the web, the number of songs played without paying the right holder is enormous. One would think that this only happens through illegal internet services, but it also happens on popular streaming platforms. Data has shown that 20 of the largest music streaming companies had more than $424 million from profits from unmatched royalties. Music streaming services make up 83% of recorded music revenues in the United States. Ironically, that is not the main source of income for most musical artists. The general public believes the streaming company will pay the artists whose songs they listen to, but that is not exactly how streaming services work that is, money they collected but did not know whom to give it to. Most of the earnings go to third-party organizations and this affects the musicians, especially less-known musicians. To tackle this issue We focused on developing a feasible solution for both listeners and musicians throughout the brainstorming process. On **GRooVE with NFTs**, musicians can sell their music using NFTs without any third-party involvement and can earn 100% of their sales. Users can easily buy their favorite artist's NFTs. On top of everything, users can join the chatroom according to their chosen genre.
